# OpenAI API Client Library in Swift

This is a community-maintained library to access OpenAI HTTP API's. The full API docs can be found here:
https://beta.openai.com/docs

## Installation ðŸ’»

### Manual

Copy source files into your own project

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)

You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in your Package.swift file or by adding directly within Xcode

`.Package(url: "https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift.git", majorVersion: 1)`

## Example Usage ðŸ¤©

Import the module in your application.

`import OpenAISwift`

Set your API token from creating one [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

`let openAI = OpenAISwift(authToken: "TOKEN")`

Create a call to the completions API, passing in a text prompt.

```swift
openAI.sendCompletion(with: "Hello how are you", maxTokens: 100) { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.choices.first?.text ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

The API will return an `OpenAI` object containing the corresponding text items.

You can also specify a different model to use for the completions. The `sendCompletion` method uses the `text-davinci-003` model by default.

```swift
openAI.sendCompletion(with: "A random emoji", model: .gpt3(.ada)) { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    // switch on result to get the response or error
}
```
For a full list of the supported models see [OpenAIModelType.swift](https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift/blob/main/Sources/OpenAISwift/Models/OpenAIModelType.swift). For more information on the models see the [OpenAI API Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models).

OpenAISwift also supports Swift concurrency so you can use Swiftâ€™s async/await syntax to fetch completions.

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendCompletion(with: "A random emoji")
} catch {
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

The latest `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is available too : 

```swift
func chat() async {
    do {
        let chat: [ChatMessage] = [
            ChatMessage(role: .system, content: "You are a helpful assistant."),
            ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Who won the world series in 2020?"),
            ChatMessage(role: .assistant, content: "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."),
            ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Where was it played?")
        ]
                    
        let result = try await openAI.sendChat(with: chat)
        
        print(result.choices.first?.message?.content ?? "Nothing")
